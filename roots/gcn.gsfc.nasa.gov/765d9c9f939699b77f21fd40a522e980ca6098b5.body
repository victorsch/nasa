<h2>
Introducing the New GCN: Kafka Broker, Circulars Service, and Website <a href="https://gcn.nasa.gov">https://gcn.nasa.gov</a>
</h2>

<p>
We are pleased to introduce the new General Coordinates Network, the evolution of the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (now referred to as GCN Classic, this website) using modern, open-source, reliable, and secure alert distribution technologies that have been established by the broader astronomy community and promoted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
</p>
<p>
GCN has a redesigned website, <a href="https://gcn.nasa.gov">https://gcn.nasa.gov</a> and a new improved method of streaming GCN Notices called GCN Classic over Kafka, and a self-service configuration of GCN Notices over Email. All three classic GCN Notice formats (text, VOEvent, 160-byte binary packet) are now also available over Kafka or self-service email. This new Kafka streaming service can be used as a drop-in replacement for GCN Classic socket and VOEvent subscribers, and the self-service emails replace GCN Classic Notice subscriptions.
</p>
<p>
The web site that you are viewing now (the old GCN Classic web site) and the legacy socket and VOEvent delivery methods will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future. However, new features and notice types will only be available on the new web site and GCN Kafka.
</p>
<h3>Effective April 17, 2023:</h3>
<h3 style="line-height: 0em">The modernized GCN Circulars experience is part of the <a href="https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars">new GCN web site</a>, where you can</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Browse and search Circulars in our all-new archive.</li>
    <li>Sign up for and manage your own email subscriptions.</li>
    <li>Enroll yourself and your colleagues to submit Circulars with arXiv-style peer endorsements for new contributors.</li>
    <li>Submit Circulars with our new Web form, or continue to submit by email.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="line-height: 0em">This legacy GCN Classic Circulars service has been disabled.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All legacy accounts are transferred to the new system. </li>
    <li>The <a href="https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_archive.html">legacy archive</a> is frozen.</li>
    <li>Email submissions to the old address will be forwarded to the new system and processed normally.  We encourage use of the <a href="https://gcn.nasa.gov/news">new submission address</a>.</li>

14 Feb 2022:  There was trouble in printing and processing of Circular #31590.
<p>
<p>
<font color="#ff0000">
<p>
27 Dec 2021:  Earlier today an acciedent in processing caused some old email Notices to be resent.
There were 3 intervals of old Notices from short windows of time: Oct 23, Nov 01, and Dec 04, 2021.
They were correct Notices of their time and content, but just retransmitted (duration of ~1 hour
between 06:40 to 07:40 UT today).  This occurred for only those recpients that use the email method.
We apologize for the confusion that occurred.
<p>
<p>
03 Nov 2021:  The Time-domain Astronomy Coordination Hub (TACH) project is pleased to announce a<br>
new community tool to access the archive of GCN Notices and Circulars.  The GCN Viewer<br>
ingests new notices and circulars in real time, and associates events detected by multiple<br>
facilities, providing useful categorization and searchability.  This first public release of the<br>
GCN Viewer provides this functionality, and new features will be added with forthcoming releases.<br>
The new TACH archive of the GCN Notices & Circulars is accesible through the GCN Viewer at<br>

Posted 23 Mar 2020 (last updated 18 Oct 20):<br>
Due to the policies and constraints during the CoronaVirus pandemic,<br>
my response to your requests and questions may not be as fast as normal.<br>
Example: changes to your site_configuration may take up to 7 days (instead of the usual 2-4 days).<br>
Being at home teleworking, requires making the site_config file change a remote operation instead of the normal on-site operation.<br>
Which is doable, but I try to keep that method to a minimum.  I will wait longer to do the file change<br>
or I will use a weekly 4-hr pass to do work on-site.<br>

The Extra UVOT IMAGES for the two recent bursts:<br>
<p>
The two most recent Swift detected GRBs have generated extra UVOT images,<br>
at longer times after the burst trigger time than is usual (hours).<br>
<p>
The extra images are the result of a misconfigured parameter in the<br>
TOO commands used to performed follow-up observations on the given burst,<br>
which caused UVOT to produce products usually only generated during<br>
the immediate Burst Response mode. This error has been fixed going forward,<br>
and we believe UVOT should not for future follow-up generate these additional images.<br>

<p>

We are having problems bringing the system back up.  The cloud server company is trying to figure out what went wrong.<br>
Stand by.<br>
The other IPnums and ports listed below are redundant servers.<br>
<p>
<font color="#000000">
Posted 06 Oct 2019.<br>
<p>
GCN VOEvent cloud-computer 209.208.78.170 will be taken off-line at 15:00 UT (Tue, Oct 15, 2019) (11:00 EDT)<br>
to upgrade the system (increased memory and disk space).  The upgrade will take 15-20 minutes.<br>
This upgrade will be done to 3 of the 9 GCN VOEvent server streams (the other 6 streams already have the bigger memories & disks).<br>
This cloud computer was the first server in the GCN cloud.  The 3 streams involved in the upgrade are:<br>
209.208.78.170 &nbspports:&nbsp;&nbsp; 8099 (public, version 1.1),&nbsp;&nbsp; 8092 (private, ver 1.1),&nbsp; &&nbsp; 8096 (private, ver 2.0).<br>
<p>
In the cluster of GCN VOEvent servers, the redundant servers are<br>
(pick the server that matches (a) your public-vs-private and (b) version number of your VOEvents you currently receive):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50.116.49.68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : port 8099, public,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 1.1,&nbsp;&nbsp; vetted & anonymous;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.169.57.253&nbsp; : port 8092, private,&nbsp;&nbsp; version 1.1,&nbsp;&nbsp; vetted only;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50.116.49.68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : port 8096, private,&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2.0,&nbsp;&nbsp; vetted only;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68.169.57.253&nbsp; : port 8096, private,&nbsp;&nbsp; version 2.0,&nbsp;&nbsp; vetted only.<br>
to which all vetted and anonymous sites can switch to if you can not tolerate a 15-20 min loss in coverage or<br>
if the upgrade would end up taking longer than predicted.<br>
<p>
After the end of the upgrade session (~15:20UT), please check this webpage for the status of the upgrade.<br>
-->
<!--
<font color="#ff0000">
05 Aug 2019:  The VOEvent server 209.208.78.170 is currently experiencing intermittant problems.<br>
I believe these problems are due to some clients connecting multiple times -- there are ~4 IPnums<br>
that connect 5 to 90 times.  They are anonymous connections (ie not listed in the GCN sites config file).<br>
I am puzzled as to why a site would make multiple connections -- what functional need is there?<br>
These sites do not resolve in IPnum lookup services.  If you are one of the multiple anonymous connectors,<br>
please contact me to explain the need for multiple connections.  Currently, I am working on a modification<br>
to the server program that will only allow a single connection.  If you have legitimate need for multiple connections<br>
please tell me and we can work out an accomodation.<br>

ALERT (20-Sep-2018 12:00 UT):<br>
GCN was off-line from 06:55 to 11:31 UT (4.6 hrs) due to a power failure in the building in which GCN is housed.<br>
The UPS for the GCN maintained power through the 3 interruptions in that window,<br>
but the building-level power and UPS's for the netwark router closets was insufficient.<br>
-->
<!--
UPDATE (15-Sep-2018):<br>
It seems there is still a few scenarios in which this new email identity-checking protocol<br>
is not working properly.  We are working on it.<br>
ANNOUNCEMENT (13-14-Sep-2018):<br>
Due to the sudden and unannounced installation (at NASA) of a new email certification/identification software package,<br>
the emails sent to gmail.com-based accounts (and some other domains) were rejected by those domains.<br>
It took about 48 hours to figure out the corrections and work-arounds to allow successful transactions.<br>
During that time ~25% of the Circualars accounts were affected.<br> 
-->
<!--
ANNOUNCEMENT (30-Jul-2018):<br>
GCN will be off-net for ~10 minutes on Wednesday Aug 1st (afternoon/evening local time)<br>
when the router for the building in which GCN is located<br>
will be rebooted for routine maintenance.<br>
-->
<!--
ANNOUNCEMENT (26-Jun-2018):<br>
There is a possibility that the GSFC network will have intermittent interruptions<br>
between 23:00 and 23:59 UT Wed Jun 27.  Goddard IT will be doing some emergency repairs<br>
to a critical power system.  If there are interruptions, then they are expected<br>
to be only a few minutes in duration each.<br>
-->
<!--
ANNOUNCEMENT (22-Jun-2018):<br>
UPDATE:  Based on one data point out of over a 1000 copies distributed,<br>
the recent Circular 22823 (redshift measurement on 180620B, z=1.1175)<br>
there can be longer delivery delays out to 1 hour.<br>
INITIAL: GSFC experienced a center-side internet problem (starting ~08:30 UT).<br>
This affected email-based deliveries with 0.5-15 min delays.<br>
And for socket-based deliveries there were no delays, but if a site broke its connection and tried to remake<br>
there may have been problems.<br>
As of 12:15 UT, things are getting better (much smaller delays).<br>.

<!--
ANNOUNCEMENT (02-Mar-2018):<br>
GCN was offline from 22:05 to 23:10 UT (65 minutes) due to a NASA-wide Internet problem.<br>

UPDATE:
Improved start/stop times:  22:07 to 23:06 UT (59 minutes).

UPDATE: 22:30 UT 04 July:  GCN has been operating properly for 34+ hours - things are back to normal.<br>
UPDATE: 15:00 UT 03 July:  The NASA Network people are investigating the routers and cables.<br>
The GCN computer ether i/f card idea has lost favor because the connectivity problem<br>
was seen in another computer in the same office (but on a different cable and wall-jack).<br>
In this last go-round, it has been running without problems since 16:00 UT 03 Jul 17.<br>
ALERT: GCN has been having intermittant problems since 02:00 UT 02 Jul throught to now (03:00 03 Jul).<br>
It has something to do with connection to all the DNS machines here at Goddard (but the problem<br>
is at the GCN end, not the DNS end).  Or it could be with the ether interface in the GCN computer.<br>
GCN is running as I type this, but but the last 25 hrs have shown that to last of order 2 to 13 hrs.<br>

There is a problem with IPnum=68.169.57.253, port 8096 LVC-enabled (VOEvents ver=2.0).  It is NOT distributing VOEvents.<br>
This is a problem ONLY with the LVC-enabled/Private-Phase voevent server; the other two Ver2.0/LVC-enabled servers are fine.<br>

You LVC-enabled/Ver2.0 customers should switch your connections to either 209.208.78.170 or 50.116.49.68, both on port 8096.<br>
My apologies for this outage.<br>
(If you are receiving GCN Notices by email or 160-byte-binary packet, there are no problems.  This is only with this<br>

ANNOUNCEMENT (12-Oct-2016):<br>
During a malformed test session while porting GCN from the current/old machine to a new/fast machine,<br>
a domain in a top-level email command caused the emails from a playback test (of a very old bust) on the new machine<br>
