      <h1>Mission Assurance Systems <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> update</h1>
      <p class="intro">Given the recent elevation of several NASA centers to Stage 4 of <a href="https://nasapeople.nasa.gov/coronavirus/">NASAâ€™s COVID-19 Response Framework</a>, we wanted to share the status of the Mission Assurance Systems (<abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">MAS</abbr>) platform, which is primarily hosted in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility at <abbr title="Ames Research Center">ARC</abbr> and partially replicated at the Kennedy Data Center at <abbr title="Kennedy Space Center">KSC</abbr>.</p>
      <p class="intro">Thanks,<br><abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">Mission Assurance Systems</abbr> staff</p>
      
      <h2>What is <abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">MAS</abbr>?</h2>
      <p><abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">MAS</abbr> is the software framework that <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> (<abbr title="Problem Analysis and Reporting Tool">PART</abbr>, <abbr title="Failure Modes Effects Analysis">FMEA</abbr>, <abbr title="Operational Control Agreements Database">OCAD</abbr>, Hazard), Exploration Systems/Advanced Exploration Systems (<abbr title="Cross-Program Operations and Maintenance Requirements and Specifications Management System">CP-OMS</abbr>, <abbr title="Cross-Program Launch Commit Criteria Management System">CP-LMS</abbr>, CP-Hazard, etc), and other Programs/Projects use to store/process engineering/safety data. A single codebase drives over 20 different applications, all of which are hosted in a shared environment we call <abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">MAS</abbr>.</p>


      <h2>What is the current status of <abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">MAS</abbr>?</h2>

      <p>All <abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">MAS</abbr> applications are online and functioning normally. Because the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> program uses MAS operationally, there are no plans to change the system status.</p>


      <h2>What is the impact of Stage 4 on <abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">MAS</abbr> operations?</h2>
      <p>There is no immediate impact. The <abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">MAS</abbr> operations team is able to securely monitor, patch, troubleshoot, and otherwise maintain the applications remotely.</p>

      <h2>How do I notify <abbr title="Mission Assurance Systems">MAS</abbr> staff of an issue?</h2>
      <p>Ideally, our modernized automated monitoring will identify service interruptions before our customers do. We have 24&times;7 general support at <a href="tel:8003318737">(800) 331-USER</a> and business hours technical support available via <a href="mailto:mas-support@mail.nasa.gov">mas-support@mail.nasa.gov</a>.</p>
